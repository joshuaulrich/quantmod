\details{
A utility to download financial statements for publicly traded companies.

Individual statements can be accessed using
standard \R list extraction tools, or by
using \code{viewFinancials}.

\code{viewFinancials} allows for the use of
date subsetting as available in the \pkg{xts}
package, as well as the specification of
the type of statement to view. BS for balance
sheet, IS for income statement, and CF for cash flow
statement. The period argument is used to identify
which statements to view - (A) for annual and (Q)
for quarterly.

\code{as.data.frame.financials} unpacks the finacials list into a wide formate data.frame
}
\value{
  Six individual matrices and a data.frame organized in a list of class \sQuote{financials}:
  \item{ IS }{ a list containing (Q)uarterly and (A)nnual Income Statements }
  \item{ BS }{ a list containing (Q)uarterly and (A)nnual Balance Sheets }
  \item{ CF }{ a list containing (Q)uarterly and (A)nnual Cash Flow Statements }
  \item{periods}{a data.frame containing Fiscal year and quarter corresponding to each statement contained in the results. 
  The \code{date} column matches the column name in the statement matrix corresponding to period. Some sources moy not include this in the output}
  
  Only the data structure itself is normalized. Individual statement matrixes use field names from the underlying source. 
  Please refer to the source documentation for definitions and explanations.

BUG FIXES
- Fixed factor bug in getSymbols.FRED.  Thanks to Josh Ulrich

- Fixed bug in [.quantmod.OHLC method when i/j was missing,
  also now returns quantmod.OHLC object consistently

MODIFICATIONS
- Added high frequency data handling - to.minutes, to.hourly,
  to.daily.  Additional work done to accomodate within rest of
  framework

- getSymbols downloads now to temp file - instead of directly to
  memory.  Fixed R issue in certain Windows installations 

- getSymbols now returns a character array of symbol names
  written to environment.

- getSymbols includes new arg - auto.assign.  If set to FALSE
  will behave like standard R functions and simply return
  loaded object.  Requires user assignment via '<-'

- Better handling of timeSeries, ts, its within entire package

NEW FUNCTIONALITY

- chartSeries rewrite.  Now manages charting with S4 objects
  stored quietly in memory.  Allowing for dynamic redraws used
  in applying technical indicators and overlays

- addTA functions.  New charting tools to add technicals to
  charts dynamically.  More on the way

- listTA, setTA, unsetTA to handle default TA args

- chartTheme function to customize chart 'look'

- last/first functions now take character strings to describe
  in words the subsetting to do.  Also negative value support
  for opposite behavior.  Additional _keep_ arg will assign
  removed data to an attribute _keep_ with the object

- getSymbols.SQLite support.  Still very clunky - though that is SQLite.

- getFX and getMetals for direct download of those types

- getQuote downloads Last,Change,Open,High,Low,Volume from Yahoo

- added documentation and fixed documentation

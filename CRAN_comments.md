Regarding the NOTE about the calls to attach():
The calls to attach() are made in the function attachSymbols().  This function is a mechanism to wrap the complexity of attaching multiple symbols (a database of potentially thousands of individual instrument names) with one simple call.  Based on previous emails with CRAN regarding this specific attach usage, and the lack of anything beyond the NOTE 'finding' the call, this seems well within the scope of behavior required by CRAN.  Note that the name of the function doing this attach is an extension of the attach name itself, which makes the function's purpose clear.
